<p>Welcome to National Legal! Full service begins immediately; there are no delays. Once your application is processed, you will receive an enrollment package from our firm, either by email or U.S. Postal Service mail. We will reach out to you shortly after the Enrollment Package is sent to schedule a welcome call with an Assessment Attorney, a strategy call with your in-state Attorney and, if applicable, in-person meeting with a representative in your area, if applicable.</p>
