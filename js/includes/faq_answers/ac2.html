<p><strong>Please</strong> call us. Please do not suffer in silence. There is no need to be on an island by yourself worrying over your debt; we are here for you and encourage your calls!</p>
<p>Being in debt is extremely common, but for some reason, has become a taboo subject. Debt is stressful, mainly because there are so many unknowns. It is normal and part of the Debt Resolution process to feel worried or unsure at times. It is our experience that discussing your concerns with your case manager, or anyone on the support team, goes a long way in alleviating worry. So, please, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
